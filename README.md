A personal project of which is a  simple snake game using java FX. 

Snake Game Main tasks: 

### The program should include the following: GamePanel,Apple,Snake,ScoreBoard,GameOver message;
#### GamePanel-- A grid of which houses the apple and snake along with a scoreboard.
#### Apple: Of which should be randomly generated on the grid.
#### Snake: Should grow everytime an apple is eaten by the snake. 
#### ScoreBoard: Should display the score when a snake eats a apple.
#### GameOver: A gameover when the user dies by eating itself, crashing into border.





####  4) Variations: â€¢ Student A: At the start of the game, the player should be able to choose the number of the colours in the range (6-10), the number of colours in the code (3 or 4), and the maximum number of guesses allowed. At the end of each game, a score should be displayed. The score is calculated by taking the number of guesses remaining, adding the number of colours in the range, then adding the number of colours in the code. 

####  5)â€¢ Student B: The player should be able to choose whether they want to play with repeating colours in the code or not. If they choose to play with repeating colours, the game should correctly support this through the gameplay. Ideas for additional functionalities for either variation (optional): âž¢ The program keeps the player vs computer score; for example, if the player has won a game, the score is 1-0. If the player continues playing, the score should be updated after each game, accordingly. âž¢ Your own ideas.
